In this repository I intend to keep copies of algorithms or data structures I implemented at some point mostly for future reference purposes. Sometimes with comments on how the algorithm/data structure works or time or space complexities.
## Sorting Algorithms
- Heapsort
- Mergesort (recursive)

## Misc.
- Integer Log2(x)
- Count Leading Zeros (CLZ)
